# Atlas Homestays Staff Mobile App

This directory contains the mobile application used by onâ€‘site staff such as cleaners and maintenance crews. It is built with **React Native** using the Expo framework.

## Purpose

- View upcoming guest arrivals and departures
- Update the status of cleaning and maintenance tasks
- Log incidents directly from a phone or tablet

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher).
2. Install the Expo CLI globally or use it via `npx`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

3. Install dependencies in this directory:

# Atlas Staff Mobile App

This directory will hold the code for a mobile application used by on-site staff members. The goal is to provide an easy way for the team to manage day to day tasks such as guest check-ins, housekeeping and maintenance logging.

The app will consume the same API used by the admin portal and guest website. Development will start with React Native using the Expo tooling.

## Setup

1. Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS release.
2. Install the Expo CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
3. From this directory, install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   Use the Expo Go app or an emulator to preview the project.

Create a `.env` file to configure values such as `API_URL` for the backend.
## Development

- Start the development server and open the Expo app on a device or simulator:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- To run on Android emulator directly:
  ```bash
  npm run android
  ```
- To run on iOS simulator (macOS only):
  ```bash
  npm run ios
  ```

The initial implementation does not yet exist. These commands are provided for when the React Native project is added.
